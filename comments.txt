***Calculating number of moves***
Time Complexity:


Space Complexity:


***Calculating sequence of moves***
How we modelled the problem as a search problem:
We create new board representations depending on possible moves and place
these in a tree structure, where the nth layer is n moves away. We then search
this tree to find a board representation that matches the desired outcome
(no black pieces remain).

Search algorithm used:
Iterative Deepening Depth First Search.

Branching factor of our search tree (if applicable):


Algorithm optimality:
Yes algorithm explores level by level (which represent number of moves),
meaning it will return the optimal/shortest set of moves to make.
