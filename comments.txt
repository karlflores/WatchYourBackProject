A program written and designed by Karl Flores & Kristian Bjarnason
for the University of Melbourne subject COMP30024, Artificial Intelligence.

***Calculating number of moves***
Time Complexity:
Can we use deepcopy? brief says standard library/textbook stuff

Space Complexity:


***Calculating sequence of moves***
How we modelled the problem as a search problem:
We create new board representations depending on possible moves and place
these in a tree structure, where the nth layer is n moves away. We then search
this tree to find a board representation that matches the desired outcome
(less than two black pieces). 

Search algorithm used:
Depends which search we use

Branching factor of our search tree (if applicable):
Depends which search we use

Algorithm optimality:
Depends which search we use
